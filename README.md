# Tafy Studio

A Robot Distributed Operation System (RDOS) that makes robotics accessible to everyone.

## What is Tafy Studio?

Tafy Studio is a comprehensive framework for building and operating robots. Unlike traditional approaches that treat robots as single computers with peripherals, Tafy Studio embraces the distributed nature of modern roboticsâ€”where multiple compute nodes work together as a cohesive system.

**Note:** We intentionally use "operation system" rather than "operating system." Tafy Studio orchestrates robot operations across distributed nodes; it is not an OS in the traditional sense.

## Key Features

- **30-Minute Quick Start**: From installation to moving robot in under 30 minutes
- **Plug-and-Play Hardware**: Automatic discovery and configuration of devices
- **Visual Programming**: Build complex behaviors without writing code
- **Distributed Architecture**: Seamlessly scale from one to many compute nodes
- **Local-First Design**: Full functionality without internet connectivity
